## ClusterR 1.0.3

* I updated the dissimilarity functions to accept data with missing values.
* I added an error exception in the predict_GMM() function in case that the determinant is equal to zero. The latter is possible if the data includes highly correlated variables or variables with low variance.
* I replaced all unsigned int's in the rcpp files with int data types
